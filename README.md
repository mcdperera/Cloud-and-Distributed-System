# Cloud-and-Distributed-System


** Course description

Distributed system architectures, models, design principles, and performance evaluation metrics.
Distributed programming paradigms and service-oriented architectures. Design and analysis of
distributed algorithms. Grid computing, cloud computing, peer-to-peer computing, and data-intensive
computing paradigms. Programming multicore and manycore systems.

** Course objectives

By the end of the course, all students should learn the following.
- learn all the important components of research: choosing an appropriate topic, doing a literature
review, designing a solution, showing results, writing a technical report, and presenting the
results orally.
- know how computer networks, cloud, and distributed systems work,
- use network programming to code a real application and to solve a problem,
- use simple data analysis tools to determine the efficiency of a solution,
- work effectively in a team.
