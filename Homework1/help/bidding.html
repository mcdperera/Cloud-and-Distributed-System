        <div>Bidding indicates how many tricks a player can play in a Round. Each player can bid between 1-13.
            But as a team they should make sure they donâ€™t bid more than 13 in total. </div>
        <img src="bidding.jpg" alt="biddig" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
        <div> Example:</div>
        <p>Player1 bids 3
        Player3 bids 4
        In total as a team they bid 7 
        The goal is to reach 250 points first. 
        Example: If Player1 bids 3 and Player3 bids 4, as a team they have to win 7 tricks to win a Round. If they win less than 7 tricks they lose the round.
        Once the all players have placed their bids, the player1 will be prompted to play the first card.</p>
